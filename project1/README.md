Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

Project By: Julian Domingo

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Create a Users Table
- [X] Define a table "users" for columns id, firstname, lastname, email, username, createdAt
- [X] Create a Page with an HTML Form
- [X] with text inputs: first_name, last_name, email, username
- [X] submits to: itself ("public/register.php")
- [X] Detect when the form is submitted
- [X] If "/public/register.php" is loaded directly, it should display the form.
- [X] If the form was submitted, it should retrieve the form data.
- [X] Validate form data
- [X] Validate the presence of all form values.
- [X] Validate that no values are longer than 255 characters.
- [X] Validate that first_name and last_name have at least 2 characters.
- [X] Validate that username has at least 8 characters.
- [X] Validate that email contains a "@".
- [X] Display form errors if any validations fail.
- [X] Do not submit the data to the database.
- [X] Redisplay the form with the submitted values filled in.
- [X] Report all errors as a list above the form.
- [X] Submit successfully-validated form values to the database.
- [X] Write an SQL statement which will insert a new record into the globitek.users table using the submitted form values.
- [X] Redirect the user to a confirmation page.
- [X] Redirect the user to the new page.
- [X] Sanitize all dynamic output for HTML.
 

The following advanced user stories are optional:

- [X] Bonus 1: Validate that form values contain only whitelisted characters.
- [X] first_name, last_name: letters, spaces, symbols: - , . '
- [X] username: letters, numbers, symbols: _
- [X] email: letters, numbers, symbols: _ @ .

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- [X] Building the development environment was troublesome. Any changes to the MySQL server will not reflect in phpMyAdmin unless its MySQL version is the exact same as the MySQL version installed on one's machine.
- [X] Having a syntactically correct SQL statement to query the database with. Especially since the text input is stored in variables, I had to learn some PHP string concatenation techniques, such as the syntax, nesting the variable inside {}, and making sure I had single quotes covering the variable itself; the documentation was helpful in providing the correct usage.
- [X] Learning the different kinds of sanitization, specifically the use cases for each function.
